# Google Sheets Data Reading Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for reading and displaying data from the created Google Sheets templates in the MOTK frontend application. The system must be able to fetch data from the 9 sheets created by the Project Setup Wizard and display them in the user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Sheet Data Retrieval

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the data from my created Google Sheets project, so that I can see and manage my shots, assets, and tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a project THEN the system SHALL fetch data from all 9 sheets (Shots, Assets, Tasks, ProjectMembers, Users, Pages, Fields, project_meta, Logs)
2. WHEN the API receives a request for sheet data THEN it SHALL return the data in a structured JSON format
3. WHEN sheet data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL cache the data for improved performance
4. IF a sheet is empty THEN the system SHALL return an empty array without errors
5. IF the Google Sheets API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: Frontend Data Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my project data displayed in organized tables, so that I can easily browse and understand my project status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sheet data is loaded THEN the frontend SHALL display the data in appropriate table formats
2. WHEN displaying Shots data THEN the system SHALL show columns: shot_id, title, status, priority, due_date
3. WHEN displaying Assets data THEN the system SHALL show columns: asset_id, name, asset_type, status
4. WHEN displaying Tasks data THEN the system SHALL show columns: task_id, name, status, assignee_id, start_date, end_date
5. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
6. IF data loading fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 3: Project Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select which project's data to view, so that I can work with multiple projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a list of available projects
2. WHEN a user selects a project THEN the system SHALL load and display that project's data
3. WHEN switching between projects THEN the system SHALL clear previous data and load new data
4. WHEN no projects exist THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to create a new project

### Requirement 4: Real-time Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to stay synchronized with Google Sheets, so that changes are reflected across all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is modified in Google Sheets directly THEN the system SHALL detect changes on next refresh
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL fetch the latest data from Google Sheets
3. WHEN multiple users are working THEN each user SHALL see the most recent data
4. IF there are conflicts during editing THEN the system SHALL show a warning dialog with options to either overwrite Google Sheets data or keep the Google Sheets version

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue working even when there are temporary issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Sheets API returns an error THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL show cached data with a warning
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. IF a sheet is corrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover or provide repair options

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the data to load quickly, so that I can work efficiently without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading project data THEN the system SHALL complete within 3 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN data is frequently accessed THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching
3. WHEN loading large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or lazy loading
4. WHEN multiple API calls are needed THEN the system SHALL batch requests where possible
5. WHEN data hasn't changed THEN the system SHALL use cached data instead of making new API calls
